1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into PostgreSQL Database.
2. **Silver Layer**: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3. **Gold Layer**: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.

# 🚀 Project Requirements

### Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

### Objective
Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

### Specifications
- **Data Sources**: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
- **Data Quality**: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.
- **Integration**: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
- **Scope** : Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.
- **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.

## Data Exploration and Analysis 🔍
The EDA process was conducted using SQL queries. 
The analysis followed a structured approach, covering various aspects of the data:

1.  **Database Exploration:** Understanding the structure and relationships within the database. 🗄️
2.  **Dimensions Exploration:** Analyzing the characteristics of the dimension tables (customers, products). 📊
3.  **Date Range Exploration:** Identifying the time period covered by the data. 📅
4.  **Measures Exploration:** Examining key metrics and their distributions. 🔢
5.  **Magnitude Exploration:** Understanding the scale of different measures. ⚖️
6.  **Ranking Analysis:** Identifying top performers (e.g., customers, products). 🏅
7.  **Change Over Time Analysis:** Tracking trends and patterns over time. 📈
8.  **Cumulative Analysis:** Examining the accumulated values of metrics. ➕
9.  **Performance Analysis:** Evaluating the performance of different aspects of the business. 🎯
10. **Data Segmentation:** Grouping data into meaningful segments for targeted analysis. ✂️
11. **Part-to-Whole Analysis:** Understanding the contribution of different parts to the overall picture. 🧩
